## About Canonocal Debate Lab (CDL)
The Canonical Debate Lab is a community of people that have come together to define a single canonical place to focus and organize all the information relevant to claims so that the collective knowledge of the world can accumulate. Wikipedia is the de-facto canonical location for reference information. It is time to define a similar platform for disputed facts and other topics of debate.

> I grew tired of the divisive bickering and misinformation so I created [Reason Score](https://reasonscore.com/), a crowd sourced super fact checking web app. I hope the underlying concept will be useful in helping people understand canonical debates.
